Personalized content recommendations are essential for user engagement on platforms like YouTube.

There is a need for an automated solution that can dynamically influence recommendation algorithms to better reflect user preferences and enhance content discovery

Our project aims to develop a web extension and use  Generative AI model to generate the required search queries and using Javascript to search the queries automatically, simulating content interactions to personalize recommendations. We will initially test this on YouTube, with plans to expand to other platforms in the future.
